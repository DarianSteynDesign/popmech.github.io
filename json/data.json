"content": "<p>The Cape Town water crisis is rapidly worsening every month, with Level 4 restrictions approved on Wednesday and Level 4B restrictions likely becoming a reality within the next 60 days. The restrictions and regulations of the city&#8217;s water crisis are changing often, here&#8217;s everything you need to know about the water crisis and how you can help keep the Mother City afloat.</p>\n<p><strong>What is Level 4?</strong></p>\n<p>We&#8217;re currently at Level 4 restrictions. Meaning the overall consumption of water per person daily is now no more than 100 litres, Level 3B did not restrict daily personal water usage at all.  This means showering for no longer than two minutes, not flushing more than three to five times a day and using grey water wherever possible.</p>\n<p>Unlike Level 3B, where irrigation with municipal drinking water for an hour two days of the week was allowed, watering gardens with municipal water is now prohibited in Level 4.</p>\n<p>Level 4 encourages irrigation with non-potable water (e.g grey water or rainwater) only on Tuesdays and Saturdays before 9am and after 6pm for an hour. The use of this water for watering gardens is discouraged for at least 7 days after rainfall. The use of non-potable water to flush toilets is also being encouraged.</p>\n<p>Topping up, filling or refilling swimming pools is prohibited. The use of portable play pools are prohibited and pool covers are being strongly encouraged. Washing of vehicles with municipal drinking water is prohibited too.</p>\n<p>Mayor Patricia de Lille says the city hopes for alternative sources of water to be able to be organised if push comes to shove, &#8220;we really are hoping that if the worst comes to the worst, the city will bring in &#8211; truck in water.&#8221; but &#8220;the best still is for people to save water.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>What would Level 4B mean for Cape Town?</strong></p>\n<p>The Level 4B restrictions would be based on daily supply and demand of water, being closely aligned with a goal of 500 million litres of use per day. We&#8217;re currently at 666 million litres of water usage per day.</p>\n<p>This level would mean that there would be no more public pools, spray pools and water would only be used purely for essential drinking, cooking and washing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We need a new relationship with water. The days of plentiful water supply in Cape Town are over,&#8221; says De Lille. &#8220;We need to embrace the fact that water scarcity is the new normal and all our future planning must accept that we are living in a drought stricken area.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Is there rainfall at the end of the tunnel?</strong></p>\n<p>Although drastic water saving plans are being made and alternative resources may be available, the limited water supply is something that we can&#8217;t live off of forever.</p>\n<p>Snow Report SA says we may get heavy rainfall sooner than we think.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fsnowreportsa%2Fphotos%2Fa.312313212229373.1073741828.312197008907660%2F1177197619074257%2F%3Ftype%3D3&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"646\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Photography <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@xusanfeng\">Levi XU on Unsplash</a></p>\n",

"content": "<p>As <a href=\"http://www.capetownetc.com/news/van-breda-trial/day-20-van-breda-evidence-finalized-trial-within-trial/\">predicted yesterday</a>, day 21 of the van Breda trial saw the state and the defence each hand up written ‘heads of argument’ to Judge Desai.</p>\n<p>By the time court had adjourned yesterday, we were all quite confused about Advocate Botha’s seemingly nonchalant manner of handling the ‘trial within a trial’ &#8211; which of course came about at his instance. Only one witness was called, but the peak of the confusion happened when the very statement that he has trying to remove from the record was handed up. Do the defence have something up their sleeve? It was really anybody’s guess what may happen next.</p>\n<p>Back to today’s proceedings.</p>\n<p>During argument, we heard Advocate Botha say “We know what is coming, and that is what we take issue with, what the state did with the information they took from my client that day” – he had been stressing S v Orrie the importance of the inadmissibility of the statement.</p>\n<p><strong>The issue here is that it is not clear-cut about whether or not Henri was a witness or a suspect, and if he was a suspect, should the rights afforded by section 35 of the constitution be extended to him?</strong></p>\n<p>The conflicting decisions around this matter have been heightened, with the defence relying on reference to S v Orrie, and the state highlighting an appeal decision in another, S v Kahn which conflicts Orrie.</p>\n<p>Referring to the defence’s argument, Judge Desai felt that Judge Bozalek went too far in S V Orrie, when he extended the constitutional pre-trial rights afforded to arrested, detained and accused persons in section 35 of the constitution. He was inclined to agree with the appeal decision in S v Kahn rather, where the court found that the rights of suspects are adequately catered by application of the well established judges rules.</p>\n<p><em>“</em><em>I do not minimise the necessity to abide by the constitutional rights of suspects. Equally however, it is important not to hamstring the police in their investigation of crime”</em></p>\n<p><em> </em>This compelling quote, by Judge Magid, clarifies the importance of Judge Desai’s decision and puts into perspective the importance of considering the matter on the facts, balancing the interests of the accused as well as that of the public while keeping our justice system in mind.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Adv B: why are we putting up this fight? Point is that we know what is to come, we know what the police then went and did <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/vanbreda?src=hash\">#vanbreda</a></p>\n<p>— Tracey Stewart (@Traceyams) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Traceyams/status/869841404796784641\">May 31, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><strong>THE STATE’S ARGUMENT</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The first issue in argument is, was the accused a suspect?</li>\n<li>Then, if he was a suspect, was he entitled to the rights afforded to him by section 35 of the Constituion?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It was pointed out by Advocate Galloway that the only evidence before the court on the issue of whether Henri was a suspect is that of Sgt. Malan.</p>\n<p>Mr. du Toit could not counter Sgt. Malan’s version yesterday. In fact, Mr. du Toit’s evidence did not take the matter any further.</p>\n<p>Sgt. Malan’s evidence was that Henri was a victim, taken to have his injuries noted. He was taken for questioning as the only witness that could provide information to the police. Dr. Albertse corroborated this version in so far as it related it Dr Albertse’s evidence in the criminal trial.</p>\n<p>Advocate Galloway argued that Sgt. Malan was a credible witness. After a disparity in his statement regarding his trip to Blue Downs as jotted in his notebook, she declared that he hadn’t intentionally misled the court.</p>\n<p>The state’s next course-of-action was to cover the law in the event that Judge Desai finds Henri was seen as a suspect, and in this regard she relied on the appeal decision of S v Kahn.</p>\n<p>Advocate Galloway pointed out that this matter was different from S V Orrie by the fact that the police had knowledge of evidence which incriminated the accused, and as such it was reasonable to suspect him. Advocate Galloway argued that in this matter, at the time of taking Henri’s statement, there was no evidence that could have made Henri a suspect.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">G: cannot ignore that the accused chose not to testify on this matter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/vanbreda?src=hash\">#vanbreda</a></p>\n<p>— Tracey Stewart (@Traceyams) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Traceyams/status/869837303224643584\">May 31, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>It was further noted that Henri was the only witness of a very serious crime. He was taken to have his injuries noted, taken to explain what happened to the police, had spent 4 hours with the police and then went home with his friends. Six hours transpired after he had given the statement, before Colonel Beneke and Sgt Adams arrived to take him for blood tests and only then indicated he was possibly a suspect in the crime.</p>\n<p>Advocate Galloway’s conclusion was that Henri’s statement was taken at a time where he was seen to be a witness of the crime, and as such should be admitted as evidence. In closing, she pointed out that if the accused was seen to be a suspect at the time, section 35 of the Constitution is not applicable to suspects.</p>\n<p>However, if Judge Desai finds it is, then the evidence in question is admissible, as admitting this evidence would not render the trial unfair nor would it be detrimental to the administration of justice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>THE DEFENCE’S ARGUMENT</strong></p>\n<p>First off, I think the defence weakened their argument by not placing Henri in the witness box.</p>\n<p>The ‘trial within a trial’ continued with Advocate Botha submitting his heads of argument and proceeding to place his argument. Earlier on in submissions by the defence, Judge Desai pointed out that there was no evidence before the court to counter the version of Sgt. Malan who stated that Henri was not a suspect.</p>\n<p>Advocate Botha then argued, using various references to case law, that the state carries the onus of proving that Henri was treated fairly &#8211; rather than the defence bearing the onus of proving that he was treated unfairly.</p>\n<p>The court will have to give due consideration to this. The state could have lead evidence of Sgt. Adams or Colonel Beneke to corroborate the version of Sgt. Malan and chose not to, as the defence chose not to lead Henri, or even the friends who did deliver clothes and collect Henri from the detective’s office.</p>\n<p>Advocate Botha then argued reasons why the evidence of Sgt. Malan should be rejected by putting the following on record:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>He lied about the manner in which Henri was dressed at the scene.</li>\n<li>He contradicted himself by saying that Henri was taken to Dr Albertse to document his injuries, when in fact, his notebook said he was taken for medical treatment and DNA analysis.</li>\n<li>He failed to disclose in his evidence in chief the fact that he had gone to Blue Downs, some 30-40 minutes away from the place Henri was being questioned.</li>\n<li>He maintained that he took the accused version down verbatim when in fact it was obvious that he had paraphrased Henri’s version.</li>\n<li>He stated Henri’s family brought him clothes when in fact it was friends who had done so.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>He further stated that in any event the accused was viewed as a suspect, it was because:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>He was taken from the scene, bloodied, injured and dressed only in his underpants.</li>\n<li>He was taken to a district surgeon, not for medical treatment, but to record his injuries and take DNA analysis.</li>\n<li>He was then taken to the detectives offices where he was kept &#8211; dressed in only his underpants and in a communal office.</li>\n<li>He was not given anything to eat</li>\n<li>He was questioned for 2 and a half hours.</li>\n<li>His statement was taken.</li>\n<li>His family was refused access to him.</li>\n<li>Later that same evening he was taken to Dr. van Zyl to have his blood tested for alcohol and drugs.</li>\n<li>van Zyl said that evening the police told her he was the alleged accused in a triple homicide.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Advocate Botha concluded that the state had failed to show beyond reasonable doubt that Henri’s statement was not taken in a manner which violated his constitutional rights and in any event, Henri was seen to be a suspect &#8211; very shortly after the police had arrived at the scene that morning.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Judge Desai you say he lied,lie is a harsh word. He was uncertain about dress lie isn&#8217;t necessary not for me to make that finding <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/vanbreda?src=hash\">#vanbreda</a></p>\n<p>— Tracey Stewart (@Traceyams) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Traceyams/status/869844439816130560\">May 31, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Judge Desai asked for an opportunity to consider argument on the matter and indicated that he would give his ruling on the matter tomorrow morning. He also noted, with both parties agreeing with him, that due to the nature of this application, as an interlocutory application in the criminal trial, he would be entitled to change his ruling prior to the end of the trial.</p>\n<p>And so, we wait in eager anticipation of Judge Desai’s finding on the matter, a finding which no matter whose favor it may be in, will become a part of our criminal law and an important part of how judges will decide the issue in matters to come.</p>\n<p>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Traceyams\">Twitter</a> for live, to-the-minute updates tomorrow at day 22 of the van Breda trial.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Photography</strong> K-Leigh Siebritz</p>\n",

"content": "<p>This morning the defence called their first and only witness, Andre du Toit, Henri’s maternal uncle, to the stand.</p>\n<p>His summoning was in support of their application that the statement made by Henri on the afternoon of 27 January 2017 should <em>not</em> be admitted as evidence in the criminal trial due to it having been obtained in circumstances where the police officers taking the statement suspected Henri of committing the crime and did not warn him of this as well as his rights contained in section 35 of the constitution.</p>\n<p>An emotional Mr du Toit told the court how he had been called to the scene of the crime that morning by the estate manager, who had Mr du Toit’s number saved as an emergency contact for the van Breda family.</p>\n<p>It was clearly a traumatic moment as he recounted the moment he realized that his sister, her husband and his nephew were dead &#8211; Judge Desai offered him a moment to collect himself.</p>\n<p>Henri’s uncle then told the court that the first thing Colonel Beneke had asked him when he had arrived on the scene that morning was “are there problems with the family?” – to which he replied that he hadn’t been aware of any and that he wasn’t sure what was meant by the question, but conceded in cross-examination by Advocate Galloway that it was possible the Colonel may have been referring to problems outside of the family with external persons.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">D: when I arrived at 12 Goske, a lot of police cars and I realized something serious happened.

He further declared that had the police told him Henri was with the detectives who were questioning him as to what happened, he would have waited there for Henri.</p>\n<p>He then called James Reade-Jahn’s mother, Christelle, close family friends of the van Breda’s, who invited Mr du Toit and his wife to the Reade-Jahn residence in Somerset West – near the hospital Marli was in.</p>\n<p>Mr. du Toit, soon after hearing about the deaths of the van Breda family members, alerted the rest of his family as well as Martin’s brothers to the devastating news. Both him and his wife were physically the nearest family relatives.</p>\n<p>Later that afternoon, Henri arrived at the house with James, his father and Alex, a close friend of Henri’s. Mr. du Toit then told the court that James’ father had presumably collected Henri from the police. Bianka and her family were also at the Reade-Jahn home.</p>\n<p>We heard that Henri was reportedly extremely emotional when he first saw his uncle, hugging each other and crying.</p>\n<p>That afternoon, Sonja du Toit, Mr. du Toit’s wife, had a look at Henri’s wounds and suggested he go for stitches as she thought the wounds were deep. The couple then left to go home as they had Sasha, the family dog, with them and wanted to take her home. Henri asked to remain with the Reade-Jahn family in order to be near to Marli.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">D: Sonja looked at his wounds and said the cut looks deep and suggested he get stitches which is why he went to hospital <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/vanbreda?src=hash\">#vanbreda</a></p>\n<p>— Tracey Stewart (@Traceyams) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Traceyams/status/869477310826721280\">May 30, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Under cross-examination, notably the first time we have seen Advocate Galloway cross-examine a witness in the trial, Mr. du Toit conceded that James, James’ father, Alex and Bianka along with her family had known where Henri was and had visited the detectives offices to deliver clothes to Henri so it cannot be said that Henri was kept in isolation by the police and nobody knew where he was, just that Mr. du Toit didn’t know and accepted that this must be the case.</p>\n<p>Advocate Galloway also put it to him that two doctors, both Dr. Albertse and Dr. van Zyl testified that stitches were not necessary, and if he disagreed? Mr. du Toit disagreed but admitted to having no medical training or qualification.</p>\n<p>It was also asked by Advocate Galloway if Henri had drank a beer in the afternoon, but Mr. du Toit told the court he never saw Henri have a beer. Advocate Galloway thus concluded that he must have had the beer after the couple had left, despite her advising him to go get stitches before their departure.</p>\n<p>My view on Henri’s uncle’s evidence is that it did not do much to advance the defence’s objection on admissibility.  His uncle seems to have a version of events which is understandably unclear considering the scene he arrived to that morning. The state made a good point of noting that friends of Henri knew where he was and were given access to him &#8211; in fact bringing him to their home when he had finished speaking to the police.</p>\n<p>We cannot ignore the fact that the police did send him home after taking his statement.</p>\n<p>Although Sgt. Malan may not have been the best witness, he seems to have genuinely thought that Henri was a victim and not a suspect, and this is ultimately what is the issue here. It doesn’t seem likely Judge Desai will conclude that Sgt. Malan thought Henri was a suspect.</p>\n<p>Without Henri’s version of what happened that day, being before the court, I am doubtful that Judge Desai will find the statement to be inadmissible. He may apply less weight to the content based on the obvious paraphrasing but I don’t see him concluding whether Henri should have been read his rights, based on the actual evidence placed before the court in the ‘trial within a trial’.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Adv Botha Defense closes this case (trial within a trial) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/vanbreda?src=hash\">#vanbreda</a></p>\n<p>— Tracey Stewart (@Traceyams) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Traceyams/status/869481364944560129\">May 30, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>The matter was postponed before lunch time today to allow both legal teams to prepare for their arguments tomorrow.

Malan is the officer who took down Henri’s statement on the afternoon of January 27th 2015 &#8211; the very statement that has lead to the <a href=\"http://www.capetownetc.com/news/van-breda-trial/van-breda-trial-within-trial-explained/\">‘trial within a trial’</a> at this stage of the murder trial.</p>\n<p>After finishing the cross-examination of Sgt. Malan, and hearing that the state will not call any more witnesses in this new twist in the trial, the defence changed their strategy regarding leading evidence from Henri van Breda. The team must be confident that they wouldn’t need Henri’s evidence to convince Judge Desai that the statement taken on the day is inadmissible.</p>\n<p>Strangely enough, Advocate Botha ended up handing up the disputed statement to Judge Desai, seemingly defeating the purpose of the application to have it found to be inadmissible – but additionally informing the judge that sometimes one must consider the contents when considering whether or not it is admissible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT CONCESSIONS</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>At no stage was Henri warned of his constitutional rights prior to giving a statement to Sergeant Malan or Colonel Beneke.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>It is unusual to ask a witness to give a blood sample to test for drugs and alcohol. Sergeant Malan confirmed that this was unusual, and Dr Van Zyl took this test on the evening of 27 January 2017 with her evidence having been admitted into court.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">B: If not a witness and its an accused? Then blood would be taken? M: it would be unusual to take blood from witness <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/vanbreda?src=hash\">#vanbreda</a></p>\n<p>— Tracey Stewart (@Traceyams) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Traceyams/status/869131618610491392\">May 29, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Sergeant Malan was adamant that Henri had been wearing a t-shirt and sleep shorts from the time he was at the scene. This is not consistent with what Dr Albertse noted when she stated that he had grey sleep shorts on when he arrived at her rooms.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Sergeant Malan said that he had been present during the questioning of Henri by Colonel Beneke, except for two occasions he had to step out – one when he left to attend to administrative work and another when he had lunch. It turns out that Sergeant Malan had written in his notebook that he had attended a murder investigation in Blue Downs sometime between taking Henri to the station and hearing his interview, a trip which he estimated to be a 30-40 minute drive. However, it was a trip in which he completed in 25 minutes, according to his notebook, this being in total, the drive there, back and the time spent in Blue Downs. Judge Desai will likely not accept this version, so if he went to Blue Downs after bringing Henri back to the station he was most likely away for most of the questioning by Colonel Beneke.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Adv B: why didnt u say that you left the office to go to Blue Downs. This morning u said u left 2 times only <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CapeTownEtc\">@CapeTownEtc</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/vanbreda?src=hash\">#vanbreda</a></p>\n<p>— Tracey Stewart (@Traceyams) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Traceyams/status/869170863974875137\">May 29, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>The version Henri gave Sergeant Malan is not exactly what Sergeant Malan had typed out. In the statement typed by Sergeant Malan, a number of spelling and grammatical errors were made which would commonly be made by an Afrikaans speaking person when translating to English. For example one would say “was” in the place of “were”.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Judge Desai tried to explain to Sergeant Malan that an English speaking person would not make those types of mistakes. Sergeant Malan would not concede that he paraphrased the statement and insisted that he took it down word for word.</p>\n<p>I think Judge Desai may accept that it is unlikely Sergeant Malan was telling the truth here, but he probably won’t believe that Sergeant Malan was trying to mislead the court. Of course this leads to the question of what else did he record incorrectly due to incorrect translation?</p>\n<p>It was for the purposes of proving this inconsistency in Sergeant Malan’s version that Advocate Botha handed up the statement in question in order to show Judge Desai that it could not have been taken down word for word due to the language and spelling used.</p>\n<p>When doing so, he advised Judge Desai that the version wasn’t completely inconsistent with what his client’s version of events were, but a number of important details were excluded and incorrectly conveyed. He felt it was important to show Judge Desai that this witness was not being truthful when he said it was Henri’s word-for-word version. He then asked Judge Desai to divorce the contents of this statement from his mind, in the event that he finds it to be inadmissible.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Advocate Botha indicated that he intends to argue Sergeant Malan’s version that no other evidence was taken from Henri in the form of specimens by Dr. Albertse &#8211; that in fact Sergeant Malan knew that evidence was taken.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Advocate Botha can only argue this by using Dr. Albertse’s evidence which has been incorporated into the ‘trial within a trial’ wherein Dr. Albertse states that she sealed specimens taken from the accused and as such Sergeant Malan must have known.</p>\n<p>Advocate Botha then closed his questioning of Sergeant Malan today.</p>\n<p>State prosecutor, Advocate Galloway, then advised that the state would not call in further witnesses regarding the trial within a trial. Advocate Botha further noted that despite putting Henri’s version of events to Sergeant Malan throughout his cross-examination, he only intended to call Henri’s uncle, Mr. du Toit, to give evidence on what happened that day.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Court Adjourned- another unusual turn of events- Adv Botha isn&#8217;t going to call Henri on the trial within a trial matter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/vanbreda?src=hash\">#vanbreda</a></p>\n<p>— Tracey Stewart (@Traceyams) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Traceyams/status/869179440777093120\">May 29, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Obviously Advocate Botha can change his mind about what evidence he wishes to lead on the statement admissibility issue at any time prior to closing the ‘trial within a trial’. He may need to re-consider his position when Henri’s uncle’s version is tested through cross-examination, but for now, the defence seems to have decided against placing Henri in the witness box &#8211; a decision which could lead to his statement being admitted as Judge Desai cannot ignore the fact that the accused has elected not to put his version into evidence and allow the state to test it.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow we will hear evidence from Mr Du Toit, Henri’s maternal uncle, in the ‘trial within a trial’ and his evidence will be limited to that issue. Thereafter, assuming that the defence closes the matter, we will hear legal argument from Advocate Galloway and Advocate Botha in order to persuade Judge Desai to make a finding on admissibility.</p>\n<p>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Traceyams\">Twitter</a> for live, to-the-minute updates from the courtroom.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Photography</strong> K-Leigh Siebritz / HM Image</p>\n",
